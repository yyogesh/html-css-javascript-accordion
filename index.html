                <div class="label">What is Azure</div>
                <div class="content">Azure is a flexible and open cloud platform that enables you to quickly build,
                    deploy, and manage applications in the data centers. Azure supports all major operating systems,
                    languages, or development tools and integrates public cloud applications with the existing IT
                    infrastructure.
                    Azure offers international class Service Level Agreements that enable you to build and run highly
                    available applications without having to focus on the infrastructure. It provides the ability to
                    automatically repair operating systems and services, and has built-in network load balancing and
                    hardware fault recovery capabilities. It supports the deployment models that allow you to upgrade
                    applications with no downtime.

                <div class="label">Where is Azure support available?</div>
                <div class="content">Billing and subscription management support is included for all Azure customers in
                    markets where Azure is offered. Technical support is available to customers who purchased a support
                    plan. Some services may not be covered in all regions immediately after general availability.

                    for Azure before.</div>

                <div class="label">How does the signup process work using GitHub?</div>
                <div class="content">You can now sign up using the “Sign-in options” link on the Azure sign-in page.
                    When you, as a GitHub user, first sign into a Microsoft product with your credentials, GitHub will
                    ask for your permission to consent. GitHub will share with Microsoft the name and public and private
                    email addresses on your GitHub account to check if you already have a Microsoft account. If it looks
                    like you already have an account, you will have the option to use that account and add your GitHub
                    account as a login method. Otherwise, a new account will be created and linked to the GitHub
                    account.</div>

                <div class="label">Which programming languages does Functions support?</div>

                    JavaScript, F#, Java and Python.

                <div class="label">What services have triggers or bindings support in Functions?</div>
                <div class="content">Avoid hard-coding access to other services like Azure Blog storage and Azure Cosmos
                    DB using triggers and bindings. Triggers are what cause a function to run and bindings are
                    declarations that connect the function to another resource.</div>
